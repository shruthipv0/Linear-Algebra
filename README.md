2. Least Squares Regression

Linear regression using least squares

Curve fitting and polynomial regression

Applications in data science and machine learning

3. Interpolation

Polynomial interpolation (Lagrange, Newton)

Spline interpolation

Applications in numerical approximation and data smoothing

4. Series

Taylor series and Maclaurin series expansion

Convergence analysis of series

Approximating functions using series

5. Root Finding

Bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, and Secant method

Finding roots of nonlinear equations

Applications in physics, engineering, and optimization

6. Numerical Differentiation

Finite difference methods

Forward, backward, and central difference formulas
